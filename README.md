# iii Demake
iii is a little "catroidvania" about a one-eyed cat leaving his comfort zone. Explore underground caverns, gain vision of other dimensions, help the inhabitants, and expand your horizons.

Originally made for Ludum Dare 38 (Jam) by Yukon W in GameMaker: Studio 1.4, this is a demake made in PICO-8.
